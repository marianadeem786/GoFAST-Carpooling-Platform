# 🚗 **GoFast** – A carpooling website that matches ‘Fastians’ with peers from the same region to ease urban transportation to and from **FAST NUCES, Lahore**.

---

## 🌐 Scope

GoFast is a web-based platform that targets the **ridesharing domain**, with a special focus on **carpooling**. While services like Uber and Yango dominate urban mobility, carpooling remains relatively untapped — especially for student-specific transportation needs.

This project aims to serve **students  of FAST Lahore**, enabling them to match with others commuting from similar locations. Initially focused on Lahore, the service is designed to grow as user adoption increases.

### 🔑 Key Features:
- ✅ **Login with FAST Email**: Only verified FAST NUCES accounts can use the service.
- ✅ **Homepage Listings**: See available drivers or passengers.
- ✅ **Google Maps Integration**: Routes are generated for optimal pickups and drop-offs.
- ✅ **Live Route Tracking**: Users can view real-time location updates of ongoing trips using Google Maps API.
- 🕒 **Schedule Management**: Drivers can set trip times and manage ride offers.
- ❗ **Messaging System**: *(Planned for future enhancement)*

> ❌ Note: The platform is currently limited to Lahore and does not include mobile app development. It also only supports carpooling **to and from FAST Lahore**.
